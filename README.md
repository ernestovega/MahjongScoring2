# Mahjong Scoring 2

Mahjong Scoring is my pet app since I started to learn Android by myself 7 years ago. It was my first app and as you can imagine it worked, but having inside a big mess. This second version 6 years later is totally renewed. 

I have put a lot of care in the _User Experience_ and I have inspired it in the Mahjong Madrid brand, but following the Material Design guideslines.

Also the _"Developer Experience"_ has been improved radically. Implementing a *Clean Architechture* with an asynchronous paradigm using *LiveData*, *RxJava*, *Room* and *Dagger*, what results not only in a fluid experience for the user, but also in less errors, that few are easier to find and fix; new evolutions can be afforded without headache and the code is so much easier to understand, in big part thanks to the *Clean Code* best practices and the applying of the *SOLID patterns* too.

For sure is not perfect and have a lot of improvable things, but is certainly far better than what there was here.

And of course any help or feedback is welcome!

You can find it on Google Play as [Mahjong Scoring MCR](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.mahjongscoring.activities).
