# Mahjong Scoring 2

Mahjong Scoring is my pet app since I started to learn Android by myself 7 years ago. It was my first app and as you can imagine it worked, but the code was a big mess. This second version 6 years later is totally renewed. 

I've put a lot of care in the _User Experience_ and it's inspired in the Mahjong Madrid brand, but following the Material Design guidelines.

Also the _"Developer Experience"_ has been improved radically by implementing a *Clean Architechture* with an asynchronous paradigm using *LiveData*, *RxJava*, *Room* and *Dagger*.
This results not only in a fluid experience for the user but also in less errors. Those few ones are easier to find and fix, new evolutions can be afforded without headache and the code is so much easier to understand. This is also in big part thanks to the *Clean Code* best practices and the applying of the *SOLID patterns*.

Probably it is not perfect and may have a lot of improvements but is certainly far better than before.
Of course any help or feedback are well received!

You can find it on Google Play as [Mahjong Scoring MCR](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.mahjongscoring.activities).
