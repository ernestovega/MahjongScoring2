# Mahjong Scoring 2

Mahjong Scoring is my pet app since I started to learn Android by myself 7 years ago. It was my first app and honestly, as you can imagine, it works, but having inside a big mess. This second version 6 years later is totally renewed. 

I have put a lot of care in the _User Experience_ and I have inspired it in the Mahjong Madrid brand, but following the Material Design guideslines.

Also the _"Developer Experience"_ has been improved radically. Implementing a *Clean Architechture* with an asynchronous paradigm between layers and components, using *LiveData*, *RxJava* and *Room*, what results in a fluid experience without lags. This also results in less errors, that few are easier to find and fix; new evolutions can be afforded without headache and the code is so much easier to understand, in big part thanks to the *Clean Code* best practices and the applying of the *SOLID patterns*.

For sure is not perfect and have a lot of improvable things, but is certainly far better than what there was here.
And of course any help is welcome!

You can find it on Google Play as [Mahjong Scoring MCR](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.mahjongscoring.activities).
